TODO :

1. CREATE TABLE
	1.1 Catch different errors with different except clauses in the top level try..except statement
	1.2 check the default values for int fields here or in the gui code


2 DESCRIBE TABLE
	2.1 is it better to return a dict containing the cols as keys for the given table and the relevant values as the values or every record on its own ?
	2.2 Should i add Extra field ? get more info
	2.3 Should i use ordered dict for the order of the columns or leave it like that ? 

GLOBAL
	Avoiding unnecessary queries :
	1.1 Cache (learn more about caching) or keep in memory the table number ,table names,table len(rows), columns info
